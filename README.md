The project **Julala** has been created during the Coding da Vinci Nieder.Rhein.Land 2021 cultural hackathon  
as a further development of the **Plantala** project realized  
during the Coding da Vinci Niedersachsen 2020 cultural hackathon.   

The web project offers the opportunity to generate, print and color mandalas from vectorized copperplate elements. 

The copperplate elements belong to the collection “Fürstlich Jülich´sche Hochzeit” ("Royal Jülich Wedding") from the workshop of Franz Hogenberg  
and show the events surrounding the wedding of Duke Johann Wilhelm of Jülich-Kleve-Berg and Margravine Jakobe of Baden in June 1585. 

_As part of the Coding da Vinci Nieder.Rhein.Land 2021 cultural hackathon,  
the Düsseldorf City Museum has provided the object data sets for the “Fürstlich Jülich´sche Hochzeit” (license CC BY 4.0 Stadtmuseum Düsseldorf)._

_All vector graphics and Julalas created for the project were provided with a CC BY-SA 4.0 license._

### MaaS (Media station as a Service)

Furthermore within the project developed the idea of **Media station as a Service (MaaS)**,  
which allows easily to reuse the framework of the **Plantala** and **Julala** projects to create new, simple Mandala generators.
